Gearlad (Seth):
Day 1: I would imagine, even though I'm a computer science student, just like most other students in the class I've had to start from square one on a lot of things in this homework, like creating networked P2P communicating nodes. That's it's best and most difficult aspect, but it will force rendering an effective learning environment. I shall continue.

I am having difficulty in creating the networked aspect of this homework as I've had little experience with sockets/server requests. This may be the most difficult aspect of this Blockchain.
